# Project Plan 

## Overview

This code shows to create a Django application that uses a predefined content to create a dynamic journal.

This journal is a lab notebook for a software development project.

A planning grid is used to organize the project tasks by milestone and role. 

This project could easily be extended to cover any user journal that contains guided prompts.

Readers are able to access the content but only authors are allowed to modify it.
