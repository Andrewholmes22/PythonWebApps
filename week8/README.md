## Book Builder

This code shows the structure of a Django application that uses a database.  Multiple data types are 
defined along with the views required to edit the data records.  This app has unique user accounts
for authors.  Each author is able to create books interactively with no access to the underlying server.

Readers are able to access the books but can't modify the contents.
