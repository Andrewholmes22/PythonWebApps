# Spiritual Nature

Humans are animals that can hear the voice of God. How we respond determines
the reality we live in.

To be human is to be a spiritual being in a physical body. We all have a spirituality 
that goes beyond religion, psychology, or culture but is integrally tied to
those pursuits.

These poems explore the supernatural longings that all humans have.
